- [Reported cases of HPAI in Wild Mammals, USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals)
- [Reported cases of HPAI in Poultry](https://publicdashboards.dl.usda.gov/t/MRP_PUB/views/VS_Avian_HPAIConfirmedDetections2022/HPAI2022ConfirmedDetections?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y)

## Sequencing data
- [Viral genetic Sequence information](https://gisaid.org/) from various sources (human, poultry, catle) on GISAID
- [Viral genetic sequence information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1102327) from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): 
- Consensus genomes made available by the [Andersen Lab](https://github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza)

## Current infrastructure (OneHealth Framework)

### Prevent
Humans
- Testing in combination with sequencing can detect a spillover event.
- Prophylactics: 
    - There are four FDA approved vaccines specific for H5N1 available: [AUDENZ](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/audenz), two by ID Biomedical ([this one](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-h5n1-virus-monovalent-vaccine-adjuvanted) and [AREPANRIX](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/arepanrix)), and the [National stockpile](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-virus-vaccine-h5n1-national-stockpile) (provided by Sanofi)
    - Tamiflu (antiviral) is an effective prophylactic against HPAI.

Animals
- Prophylactics for animal use: 
    - Several veterinary avian influenza vaccines are licensed in the U.S.. However, these are for certain virus subtypes (H5N1, H5N3, and H5N9), and none are fully matched to the more virulent strain of H5N1 found in the current outbreak. Novel or currently licensed vaccines are being updated to the current strain and/or evaluated for use in other animals.
    - The USDA has a [special program for field trials](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/cvb-notice-24-13-field-studies-nonviable-non-replicating-veterinary-vaccines) of cow vaccines. Learn more and apply here.
    - [January 8th 2024](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/01/08/us-department-agriculture-announces-15-additional-states-onboard-national-milk-testing-strategy-h5n1): At least 7 Cow vacine candidates are undergoing trials.
- Prevent wild birds from getting in contact with your animals
- Don't provide feed that is possibly contaminated, e.g. raw milk

Environment
- Improved biosecurity on farms is the best approach to prevent spread of viruses.

### Control
- Detection and testing:
    - There are no lateral flow assays for human use validated for Influenza A H5N1. 
    - Lateral flow assays for veterinary use are available online. 
    - The CDC does not have recommendations for H5N1 specific RT-PCR tests for humans available yet. H5N1 testing methods for human samples have been developed by academic labs. For example, the methods of the [Pinsky lab](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653224000854?via%3Dihub).
- Quarantine or culling might be neccesary if a herd is infected, which is usually controlled by local authorities. You can find numbers on Poultry culling [here](https://publicdashboards.dl.usda.gov/t/MRP_PUB/views/VS_Avian_HPAIConfirmedDetections2022/HPAI2022ConfirmedDetections).
- Human case numbers are likely largely underestimated, as evidenced by [serological assays](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm).

### Treat
- Treatment for humans:
    - Xofluza is an effective treatment
