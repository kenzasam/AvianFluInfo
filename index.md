## About Bird Flu

Bird Flu, also called Avian Influenza, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), is a disease caused by a flu virus, specifically an Influenza A virus subtype called H5N1.

Avian flu is a virus that naturally spreads among wild birds. It can also infect poultry and other kinds of animals, including cows. Animals can also infect humans.

There is currently an active bird flu outbreak in the United States.

### Risk

**Risk to animals**  
Avian influenza has a high mortality rate in 

**Risk to humans**  
Avian flu can infect humans through animal exposure (feces and body fluids, like blood, mucus, and saliva) or exposure to highly contaminated environments. Infected people may not develop any symptoms and others may develop mild ones. Early symptoms in people can include cough, high fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache. In severe cases, pneumonia, seizures, a changed mental state or death can occur. Of the human cases between 2003 and 2024, mortality rate has been 52% (source). Numbers on the current outbreak can be found below.

Currently there has not been any detection of human-to-human transmission. However, small mutations (e.g. a single mutation as documented here) can turn the virus transmissible between humans and highly pandemic potential.

The CDC is actively monitoring the situation. The risk for the public is listed as Low.

People with increased risk of exposure to novel influenza A viruses associated with disease in humans: Waterfowl hunters, poultry workers, backyard bird flock owners, livestock farmers, and livestock workers. Livestock workers with cattle are currently a primary concern. The USDA is monitoring and assisting these workers.

### Biosecurity

**Countermeasures and surveillance**  
There are vaccines available in the case of an outbreak in the national stockpile (source). Flu vaccines have low efficacy (source). The efficacy of the bird flu vaccines against HPAI is unknown.   
There are antivirals and treatments availale that work for other Influenza A subtypes.  
There are no lateral flow assays for humans validated for Influenza A H5N1 (source).

**General Precautions**  
Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Wild birds can have avian flu even if they don’t look sick. Do not touch sick or dead animals, or surfaces contaminated with animal feces, if possible. Avoid tracking those materials home or to backyard flocks on boots and other items.

Additional precautions should be taken by people frequently exposed to animals, which you can read more about below.
