The [USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza) can help producers with:
* PPE and/or laundering
* Biosecurity planning and implementation
* Heat treatment for waste milk
* Veterinarian costs

## Immediate Actions for Dairy Farmers
1. If you work with dairy cows suspected or confirmed to have avian flu and you start to feel sick, please contact your local public health department.
2. Report dead or sick birds or animals to the USDA toll-free at 1-866-536-7593
3. Follow National Milk Testing (NMTS). If you are in a required state: test raw (unpasteurized) milk intended for pasteurization, and report HPAI positive milk (Ferderal requirement since Dec 6, 2024).
5. Get clearance before interstate movement of cattle  (Federal requirement since April 24, 2024)
6. Improve biosecurity (Highly advised): [EN](https://nationaldairyfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Enhanced-Biosecurity-Prep-Guide-1.pdf) , ES
7. Track movement of your cattle using an Animal Movement Log (Highly advised): [EN]()
