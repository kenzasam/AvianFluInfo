## About Bird Flu

Bird Flu, also called Avian Influenza, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), is a disease caused by a flu virus, specifically an Influenza A virus subtype called H5N1.

Avian flu is a virus that naturally spreads among wild birds. It can also infect poultry and other kinds of animals, including cows. Animals can also infect humans.

### Risk

**Risk to animals**  
Avian influenza has a high mortality rate in 

**Risk to humans**  
Avian flu can infect humans through animal exposure (feces and body fluids, like blood, mucus, and saliva) or exposure to highly contaminated environments. Infected people may not develop any symptoms and others may develop mild ones. Early symptoms in people can include cough, high fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache. In severe cases, pneumonia, seizures, a changed mental state or death can occur. Of the human cases between 2003 and 2024, mortality rate has been 52% (source). Numbers on the current outbreak can be found below.

Currently there has not been any detection of human-to-human transmission. However, small mutations (e.g. a single mutation as documented here) can turn the virus transmissible between humans and highly pandemic potential.

The CDC is actively monitoring the situation. The risk for the public is listed as Low.

People with increased risk of exposure to novel influenza A viruses associated with disease in humans: Waterfowl hunters, poultry workers, backyard bird flock owners, livestock farmers, and livestock workers. Livestock workers with cattle are currently a primary concern. The USDA is monitoring and assisting these workers.

### Biosecurity

**Countermeasures and surveillance**  
There are vaccines available in the case of an outbreak in the national stockpile (source). Flu vaccines have low efficacy (source). The efficacy of the bird flu vaccines against HPAI is unknown.   
There are antivirals and treatments availale that work for other Influenza A subtypes.  
There are no lateral flow assays for humans validated for Influenza A H5N1 (source).

**General Precautions**  
Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Wild birds can have avian flu even if they don’t look sick. Do not touch sick or dead animals, or surfaces contaminated with animal feces, if possible. Avoid tracking those materials home or to backyard flocks on boots and other items.

Additional precautions should be taken by people frequently exposed to animals, which you can read more about below.

## FAQ (Page)

### For the general public

* What are we currently doing to combat the spread of bird flu?  
  * USDA National milk testing (started Dec 6), CDC is using its Influenza A capacity to test for H5N1  
* Is milk safe to drink?  
  * Pasteurized milk is safe to drink. The CDC advises against drinking raw milk.  
* I’m sick. Can it be bird flu?  
  * The risk to the public is currently listed as low. Please consult your physician.  
* How likely is this going to become a pandemic Influenza A?  
  * Fff  
* I found (a) dead animal(s). What do I do?  
  * Do not touch the animal  
  * If you find dead animals:  
    * Colorado: Notify your local Colorado Parks and Wildlife office if you find three or more dead wild birds in a specific area within two weeks, or if you find sick or dead mammals.

### For researchers and the scientific community

### For farm workers and farmers working with cattle, swine and poultry

* I think my herd is sick. What do I do?  
  * Colorado: If you have questions about sick or dead animals on the farm, ask your farm manager and herd veterinarian. Immediately contact and report disease to the State Veterinarian’s office by calling 303-869-9130 or using the reportable disease case report form.  
* I think I am sick. What do I do?  
  * Colorado: call CDPHE at 303-692-2700 (after normal business hours: 303-370-9395). The Department can help you get a flu test and medicine if you need it.  
* I want to implement practices to safeguard my herd. Where can I find more information?  
  * US: Contact your local state vet:  
* I want to implement practices to safeguard my workers. Where can I find more information?  
  * Contact your local state vet:  
  * Implement the CDC recommended guidelines  
* Is there financial assistance to help me implement safe biosecurity practices?  
  * US: Yes. The USDA provides financial assistance for sampling costs, milk offset,   
  * Canada:
