## OneHealth Framework 

### Prevent

Humans
* Testing in combination with sequencing can detect a spillover event.
* Prophylactics: 
** There are four FDA approved vaccines specific for H5N1 available: [AUDENZ](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/audenz), two by ID Biomedical ([this one](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-h5n1-virus-monovalent-vaccine-adjuvanted) and [AREPANRIX](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/arepanrix)), and the [National stockpile](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-virus-vaccine-h5n1-national-stockpile) (provided by Sanofi)
** Tamiflu (antiviral) is an effective prophylactic against HPAI.

Animals
* Prophylactics for animal use: 
** Several veterinary vaccines specific to H5N1 are available. 
* Prevent wild birds from getting in contact with your animals
* Don't provide feed that is possibly contaminated, e.g. raw milk

Environment
* improved biosecurity on farms is the best approach to prevent spread of viruses.

### Control
* Detection and testing:
** There are no lateral flow assays for human use validated for Influenza A H5N1 (source). 
** Lateral flow assays for veterinary use are available online. 
** The CDC does not have recommendations for H5N1 specific RT-PCR tests for humans available yet. H5N1 testing methods for human samples have been developed by academic labs. For example, the methods of the [Pinsky lab](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653224000854?via%3Dihub).
* Quarantine or culling might be neccesary if a herd is infected, which is usually controlled by local authorities.

### Treat
* Treatment for humans:
** Xofluza is an effective treatment
