## Other data
* [Phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 on Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/avian-flu/h5n1/ha/all-time@2024-06-18)
* [Detection of HPAI in Wild Mammals, USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals)

## Raw data
* [Genetic Sequence information](https://gisaid.org/) from various sources on GISAID
* [Genetic sequence information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1102327) from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): 
* [Wastewater surveillance data](https://data.wastewaterscan.org/)

## Tools and methods
* Consensus genomes made available by the [Andersen Lab](https://github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza)
* The CDC does not have recommendations for H5N1 specific RT-PCR tests for humans available yet. H5N1 testing methods for human samples have been developed by academic labs. For example, the methods of the [Pinsky lab](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653224000854?via%3Dihub).
* There are no lateral flow assays for human use validated for Influenza A H5N1 (source).
