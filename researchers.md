## Raw data
* [Viral genetic Sequence information](https://gisaid.org/) from various sources (human, poultry, catle) on GISAID
* [Viral genetic sequence information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1102327) from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):

## Tools and methods
* Consensus genomes made available by the [Andersen Lab](https://github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza)
* The CDC does not have recommendations for H5N1 specific RT-PCR tests for humans available yet. H5N1 testing methods for human samples have been developed by academic labs. For example, the methods of the [Pinsky lab](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653224000854?via%3Dihub).
* There are no lateral flow assays for human use validated for Influenza A H5N1 (source). 
* Tamiflu is an effective prophylactic against HPAI. A vaccine stockpile exists in the US, however vaccination efficacy is unclear.
* Xofluza is an effective treatment
* There are four FDA approved vaccines specific for H5N1 available: [AUDENZ](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/audenz), two by ID Biomedical([this one](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-h5n1-virus-monovalent-vaccine-adjuvanted) and [AREPANRIX](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/arepanrix)), and the [National stockpile](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/influenza-virus-vaccine-h5n1-national-stockpile) (provided by Sanofi)
